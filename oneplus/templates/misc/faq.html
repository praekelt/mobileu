        <h3 class="left-font title">When will I get my airtime reward?</h3>
        <p class="left-font">Airtime is disbursed on a Monday</p>

        <h3 class="left-font title">How much is my airtime reward?</h3>
        <p class="left-font">R5</p>

        <h3 class="left-font title">My answer was not presented as an option. What does this mean?</h3>
        <p class="left-font">There is a discussion box below every challenge. Send us a message if you don’t think the correct answer has been displayed. Tell us what you think the answer should be and we’ll look into it for you.</p>

        <h3 class="left-font title">I chose the right answer but it says I got it wrong. What does this mean?</h3>
        <p class="left-font">There is a discussion box below every challenge. Send us a message if you think that the answer is incorrect. Tell us what you think the answer should be, and we will look into it for you.</p>

        <h3 class="left-font title">Can a friend join?</h3>
        <p class="left-font">Not yet, but we’ll be opening up more spaces soon.</p>

        <h3 class="left-font title">Why are there only 3 questions per day?</h3>
        <p class="left-font">Research shows that consistent daily practice throughout the year is the best way to revise maths. It’s also the quickest way to get through your maths revision and do your other homework.</p>

        <h3 class="left-font title">What if I miss a day?</h3>
        <p class="left-font">That’s ok! You can answer the challenges you missed the next day. But to earn badges or airtime rewards, make sure you’ve completed a full week’s revision by Saturday. Our system is reset each Sunday.</p>

        <h3 class="left-font title">I changed my phone number. What should I do?</h3>
