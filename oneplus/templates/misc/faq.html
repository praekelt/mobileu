        <p class="left-font title">When will I get my airtime reward?</p>
        <p class="left-font">Airtime is disbursed on a Monday</p>

        <p class="left-font title">How much is my airtime reward?</p>
        <p class="left-font">R5</p>

        <p class="left-font title">Why are there only 3 questions per day?</p>
        <p class="left-font">Research shows that consistent daily practice throughout the year is the best way to revise maths. It’s also the quickest way to get through your maths revision and do your other homework.</p>

        <p class="left-font title">What if I miss a day?</p>
        <p class="left-font">That’s ok! You can answer the challenges you missed the next day. But to earn badges or airtime rewards, make sure you’ve completed a full week’s revision by Saturday. Our system is reset each Sunday.</p>
