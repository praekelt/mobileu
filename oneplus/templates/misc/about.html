        <p>
            dig-it is an initiative between Investec and Praekelt Foundation,
            with the aim of giving learners the information and guidance that they need in order to succeed in Maths.
            The project is currently tailored for Grade 10, 11, and 12 learners, but aims to extend to cover the full high school
            curriculum in a number of South African languages in the near future.
